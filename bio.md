I was born in Hong Kong, China. At the age of 6 my parents moved to Europe, to open a Chinese restaurant in the Netherlands. There, in the small city of Maastricht, I grew up, wondering why my parents didn’t move to Paris, as they originally intended to and I graduated from the University of Amsterdam with a masters degree in Communication Sciences.

In the end I became a documentary film maker, not a restaurant owner. 

I like telling stories. Stories that make you laugh, stories that make you cry. The stories that I like to see myself in the cinema, or on TV, binging away. Those are the stories I like to tell. My films have been broadcast and screened in the theatres nationally and internationally.
