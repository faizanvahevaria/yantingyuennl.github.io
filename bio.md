Yan Ting Yuen was born in Hong Kong, China. At the age of 6 her parents moved to Europe, to open a Chinese restaurant in the Netherlands. There, in the small city of Maastricht, she grew up, wondering why her parents didn’t move to Paris, as they originally intended to and she graduated from the University of Amsterdam with a masters degree in Communication Sciences.

She started her film career assisting in several film- and television productions. Yuen made her director’s debut in 2001 with the short documentary ‘Chin.Ind.: Life behind the serving hatch’ which was nominated for the National Dutch Film Award. Her second film is the feature length musical documentary ‘Yang Ban Xi, the 8 model works’, nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance Filmfestival 2005 and was awarded Prix du Meilleur Essai at the Montreal International Festival of films on art 2007. YBX was also released in limited theatres in the US. Then she directed ‘Dinner with Murakami’, a mid-lenght documentary about the surrealistic world evoked by the books of Japanese best-selling author Haruki Murakami, which won the audience award at the Berlin Asian Hot Shots festival 2008. In 2012 she helmed the highly rated (1 million viewers in the Netherlands) feature length documentary 'The Secret of Hema'.
